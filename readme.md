# micro template usage

This project is demonstrating how to use the microtemplate module.  
Microtemplate is a small render function that is based on http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/#postcomment  
It's a simple function that was written by John Resig (the lead dev of jQuery) and was designed for speed. It can run on the client or on the server.  
Here are more template engines: http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/

I use the 'fs' module to read the template file into a variable at build-time.
